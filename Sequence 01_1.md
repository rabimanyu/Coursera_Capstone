# 01 INTRODUCTION
The detection of new businesses is an area of improvements for Kelurahan (Municipal Village) government authority.
As the central government policy to relax the issuance of business license, it is not required for the business owner to have survey visits from borough authority. This will have consequence in the enforcement of many of the Provincial regulations, including consumption tax, sanitation and hygiene, building standards, among other things.
This proposal views that pertinent officials in the Kelurahan dan Kecamantan (that supervises Kelurahan) level of government can find better solution to address this
## Current/Existing Solution
The current solution is to do patrols by the city order enforcer, a specific policing agency that is structured to the Kelurahan (Municipal Village authority). That proves to be time consuming and resourced constrained, as a Kelurahan's population can reach more than fifty thousands of people.
## Proposed Solution
If a Kecamatan  and Kelurahan authorities can detect new business by other means, this will be more efficient both to the Kecamatan and business owners. The use of consumer-generated data when they start the opening of business, through platform such as Foursquare and Google, can be linked to the dashboard of a Kecamatan. An officer of the Kecamatan can start to file and investigate whether the required business information related to taxes, health, and so on are fulfilled, and if not satisfactory, the officer can use the geolocation data to visit the business place.
